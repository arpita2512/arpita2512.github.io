:::{#profile}
### Hello!

I am a PhD student within the [UKRI CDT in AI for Medical Diagnosis and Care](https://ai-medical.leeds.ac.uk/) at the University of Leeds. My doctoral research focuses on using generative AI to create patient simulations for medical training. I am fortunate to be supervised by [Professor David Hogg](https://eps.leeds.ac.uk/staff/84/professor-david-hogg), [Dr Duygu Sarikaya](https://eps.leeds.ac.uk/computing/staff/13320/dr-duygu-sarikaya), [Dr Jonathan Darling](https://medicinehealth.leeds.ac.uk/medicine/staff/257/dr-jonathan-darling) and [Professor Vania Dimitrova](https://eps.leeds.ac.uk/staff/184/professor-vania-dimitrova).

Before starting my PhD, I was a [Data Science for Social Good fellow](https://warwick.ac.uk/research/data-science/warwick-data/dssgx/dssgx2022/) at the University of Warwick, where I worked with Save The Children UK and UNICEF to [map child poverty across sub-Saharan Africa](https://www.childatlas.org/blog/mapping-child-poverty). My background is in Computing, and Iâ€™ve previously worked on research projects at the intersection of AI and healthcare.

### Other Activities {#sec-other}

I am involved in relevant activites beyond my research. I'm a student representative for my CDT and helped organise our annual CDT conference in [2025](https://ai-medical-cdt.github.io/conference2025/) and [2024](https://sites.google.com/view/leedsaimedicalcdtconference?usp=sharing) (also moderated the industry panel in 2024). I've also been involved in STEM engagement through the [Iâ€™m a Scientist, Get me out of here](https://ai24.imascientist.org.uk/profile/arpitasaggar/) programme. During my master's, I edited the university's annual tech magazine, [Srijan](https://cs.du.ac.in/students/student-activities/srijan/), and volunteered as a programming mentor at the Uplift Project by GirlScript Foundation.

Outside of academic life, I enjoy listening to music, swimming, playing chess and badminton, roller skating and bowling (though I'm not very good at it ðŸ˜…). Below are some pictures taken during my PhD journey.
