### Hello!

I'm a PhD student within the [UKRI CDT in AI for Medical Diagnosis and Care](https://ai-medical.leeds.ac.uk/) at the University of Leeds. My research focuses on using generative AI to create patient simulations for medical training. I'm fortunate to be supervised by [Professor David Hogg](https://eps.leeds.ac.uk/staff/84/professor-david-hogg), [Dr Duygu Sarikaya](https://eps.leeds.ac.uk/computing/staff/13320/dr-duygu-sarikaya), [Dr Jonathan Darling](https://medicinehealth.leeds.ac.uk/medicine/staff/257/dr-jonathan-darling) and [Professor Vania Dimitrova](https://eps.leeds.ac.uk/staff/184/professor-vania-dimitrova).

Before starting my PhD, I was a [Data Science for Social Good fellow](https://warwick.ac.uk/research/data-science/warwick-data/dssgx/dssgx2022/) at the University of Warwick, where I worked with Save The Children UK and UNICEF to [map child poverty across sub-Saharan Africa](https://www.childatlas.org/blog/mapping-child-poverty). My background is in Computing, and Iâ€™ve previously worked on research projects at the intersection of AI and healthcare.
