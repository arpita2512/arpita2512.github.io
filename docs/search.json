My doctoral research is focused on simulating virtual patients to support medical training, and I’m fortunate to be supervised by Professor David Hogg, Dr Duygu Sarikaya, Dr Jonathan Darling and Professor Vania Dimitrova.\nBefore starting my PhD, I was a Data Science for Social Good fellow at the University of Warwick, where I worked with Save The Children and UNICEF to map multidimensional child poverty across sub-Saharan Africa. My background is in Computing, and I’ve previously worked on research projects at the intersection of AI and healthcare."
