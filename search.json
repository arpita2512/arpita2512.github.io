My research focuses on using generative AI to create patient simulations for medical training. Iâ€™m fortunate to be supervised by Professor David Hogg, Dr Duygu Sarikaya, Dr Jonathan Darling and Professor Vania Dimitrova.\nBefore starting my PhD, I was a Data Science for Social Good fellow at the University of Warwick, where I worked with Save The Children UK and UNICEF to map child poverty across sub-Saharan Africa. My background is in Computing, and Iâ€™ve previously worked on research projects at the intersection of AI and healthcare."

Iâ€™m a student representative for my doctoral training centre and a student organiser for our CDTâ€™s annual conference in June 2025. I was part of the organising team in 2024 as well, and moderated the industry panel at the event. Iâ€™ve also been involved in STEM engagement through the Iâ€™m a Scientist, Get me out of here programme. During my masterâ€™s, I edited the universityâ€™s annual tech magazine, Srijan, and volunteered as a programming mentor at the Uplift Project by GirlScript Foundation.\nOutside of academic life, I enjoy listening to music, swimming, playing chess and badminton, roller skating and bowling (though Iâ€™m not very good at it ðŸ˜…).
