I was part of the organising team in 2024 as well, and moderated the industry panel at the event. Iâ€™ve also been involved in STEM engagement through the Iâ€™m a Scientist, Get me out of here programme. During my masterâ€™s, I edited the universityâ€™s annual tech magazine, Srijan, and volunteered as a Python programming mentor at the Uplift Project by GirlScript Foundation.\nOutside of academic life, I enjoy listening to music, swimming, playing chess and badminton, roller skating and bowling (though Iâ€™m not very good at it ðŸ˜…).

    "text": "Hello!\nIâ€™m a PhD student within the UKRI CDT in AI for Medical Diagnosis and Care at the University of Leeds. My research focuses on using generative AI to create patient simulations for medical training. Iâ€™m fortunate to be supervised by Professor David Hogg, Dr Duygu Sarikaya, Dr Jonathan Darling and Professor Vania Dimitrova.\nBefore starting my PhD, I was a Data Science for Social Good fellow at the University of Warwick, where I worked with Save The Children UK and UNICEF to map child poverty across sub-Saharan Africa. My background is in Computing, and Iâ€™ve previously worked on research projects at the intersection of AI and healthcare."
