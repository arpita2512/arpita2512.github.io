### Researcher{style="text-transform:none;"}

*Data Study Group, Alan Turing Institute* [Dec 2023 -- Dec 2023]{.cvdate}

A short research project in collaboration with the [UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology](https://www.ceh.ac.uk/) to apply machine learning for biodiversity monitoring. [REPORT](https://www.turing.ac.uk/news/publications/data-study-group-final-report-uk-centre-ecology-hydrology-ukceh)

-   Developed methods for analysing how variations in weather (temperature, rainfall, sunshine and wind) affect species abundance for moth populations.
-   Produced interactive data visualisations showing spatial distributions of different species to promote stakeholder engagement and interest in biodiversity monitoring.

### Fellow{style="text-transform:none;"}

*Data Science for Social Good Foundation and University of Warwick* [Jun 2022 -- Aug 2022]{.cvdate}

A joint project with UNICEF and Save the Children. The aim was to predict multi-dimensional child poverty in Sub-Saharan Africa to optimise resource allocation.

-   A [Python package](https://github.com/DSSGxUK/s22_savethechildren) to produce high-resolution poverty estimates using data from Google Earth Engine, Facebookâ€™s ads connectivity graph and Relative Wealth Index, and open telecommunications tower networks. Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) to ground predictions of the machine learning model(s). 
-   Led the development of an autoencoder-based feature extractor for GEE rasters and produced uncertainity estimates for the model(s) using conformal prediction.
-   Results presented at the [UN World Data Forum 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM1LPiqHSFA&list=PL5fDyB21zyLNy5WZAXosFc6yfeZw9ISeR&t=754s) and published as a chapter in the [Handbook on Child Poverty and Inequality](https://www.e-elgar.com/shop/gbp/handbook-on-child-poverty-and-inequality-9781802200423.html).
